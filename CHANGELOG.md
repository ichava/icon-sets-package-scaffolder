## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **A failed SBOM download no longer takes the whole release down.** `release.yml` generates the
  SBOM before it publishes, and the Syft installer fetches its checksums from GitHub's
  release-asset CDN. On 2026-09-21 that answered `504` for about twenty minutes, failing the job
  four times *before* the publish step — so the tag existed with no release behind it, which is
  the drift the release table exists to catch, produced by the release machinery itself.

  Two changes. The step now retries once after 45 seconds, which covers a single transient `504`
  — the common case. And a second failure no longer fails the job: the release publishes without
  the asset and emits a `::warning::` naming the re-run.

  **The two failure states are not equally bad, and that asymmetry is the whole design.** A
  release missing an attachment is repaired by re-running this workflow, which re-attaches it. A
  tag with no release persists silently until a person notices. Preferring the recoverable one
  is worth the loss of "every release always carries an SBOM" as an absolute.

  `fail_on_unmatched_files: false` is now stated on the publish step. It is already the action's
  default, but the point of this change is that a missing SBOM must not fail the publish, so it
  should not rest on a default a future reader has to know.

### Fixed

- **A transient CDN failure can no longer take the whole release down.** `release.yml` generates
  the SBOM before it publishes, and the Syft installer fetches its checksums from GitHub's
  release-asset CDN. On 2026-09-21 that answered `504` for about twenty minutes, failing the job
  four times before the publish step — so the tag existed with no release behind it, which is
  exactly the drift the release table is meant to catch.

  The step now makes two attempts, 45 seconds apart. That covers a single transient `504`, the
  common case. It does not cover a sustained outage, and deliberately does not try: no in-job
  backoff is worth twenty minutes, so re-run the job once the CDN is back.

  The retry carries no `continue-on-error`, so two failures still fail the release. The SBOM is
  part of the contract — publishing without one silently would be worse than failing loudly.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-21

First release. Extracted from `ichava/core`, where the generator was a single
737-line command class reachable only by driving interactive prompts.

### Added

- `ichava::icon-package-scaffolder.make`, the scaffolding command. Namespaced per
  `V59`; no bare alias is registered, so nothing claims Laravel's `make:` namespace
  the way core's `make:icon-package` did.
- `Actions\ScaffoldIconPackage`, the package's public API. Takes a
  `PackageDefinition` and a `TargetPath`, returns a `ScaffoldResult`. A caller with
  no terminal -- a test, a CI job, a queued job -- can generate a package without
  a prompt.
- `Domain\PackageDefinition`, which validates once and derives every public name.
  The rules used to be closures in prompt `validate:` arguments, so an
  option-driven run enforced none of them.
- `Support\TargetPath`, which resolves a destination without touching the
  filesystem and refuses the filesystem root. `rtrim` turns `/` into `""` and
  `C:\` into `C:`; both used to fall through to being treated as relative.
- A publishable stub tree, and `ichava.icon-package-scaffolder.stubs_path` for
  pointing the generator at your own.
- `StubEstateParityTest`, moved here from `ichava/core` with the stub tree it guards. It measures
  a scaffolded package against `ichava/flag-icons` at `origin/main` rather than against literals,
  because a literal encodes the estate as it was the day it was written and then ages silently
  beside the thing it was supposed to guard. Core's CI cloned the sibling for it; that clone
  moved here too.

  It reads the pack through `git ls-tree` and `git show`, not off disk and not through
  `git archive`. Both of those are wrong in ways that took a failure each to find. The working
  tree makes the guard answer differently depending on what branch somebody has open next door,
  red in one checkout and green in another for a reason CI cannot reproduce. `git archive`
  applies `export-ignore`, and every pack export-ignores `.github`, `docs`, `tests` and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` to keep them out of dist tarballs -- so four of the things this compares
  would not be in the archive at all, and the workflow case failed claiming the estate ships none.

  The cost is a sequencing constraint that is now visible rather than hidden: a change moving
  both the stub and the estate is red here until the estate side merges. Land the pack first,
  then the stub -- which is how the `^0.2.5 || ^0.3` constraint below actually got there, in two
  steps rather than one, with the guard red in between and saying why.
- 59 tests. The extraction was gated on generating byte-identical output to core's command for
  both a single-set and a multi-variant pack -- 24 files and 25 files, `diff -r` clean against
  core at `a902a5e`.

### Changed

- Generation refuses a non-empty destination unless forced, rather than prompting
  and proceeding.
- Running with `--no-interaction` completes from options instead of blocking on a
  TTY that is not there.

### Known behaviour, inherited and pinned

- The `Icons` suffix is appended to the name you type, so `HeroIcons` yields
  `acme/hero-icons-icons` and `Acme\HeroIconsIcons`. Pinned by a test rather than
  changed, because changing it silently would rename every class in a pack
  scaffolded before the change.
- A scaffolded pack's update command is named `ichava::<slug>-icons.update`
  regardless of the vendor you give. Inherited from the stub.
